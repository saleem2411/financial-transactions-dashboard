# Project Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides actionable insights into financial transactions. It aims to track and analyze payments, credits, and debits by customer, status, and category, highlight top contributors, and monitor monthly trendsâ€”enabling data-driven financial decision-making and improved transparency.

# Project Insights
- The project tracked 1M worth of transactions, reflecting strong financial activity.
- Debit (0.61M) slightly exceeded Credit (0.54M), showing higher outflow than inflow.
- Payments (607K) were higher than receipts (545K), suggesting more money paid out than collected.
- A few key contributors dominate, with K V Srinivasa Rao alone contributing 0.21M, highlighting dependency on limited sources.
- Monthly trends show irregular patterns, with a peak in March 2025 (0.33M) and lows in Aug 2024 & Jan 2025 (~0.03M).

# Final Conclusion
The dashboard shows 1M worth of transactions with outflows slightly higher than inflows. A few contributors dominate, and irregular monthly patterns highlight dependency and forecasting challenges. Improving data quality and balance will support stable financial growth.
